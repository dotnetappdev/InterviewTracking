2. **InterviewTracking.Api** - ASP.NET Web API backend
3. **InterviewTracking.Shared** - Shared models and DTOs

### Technologies
- .NET 10
- .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
- ASP.NET Core Web API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 10 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider
- Android SDK (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS/macOS development on Mac)

### Building the Solution

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotnetappdev/InterviewTracking.git
cd InterviewTracking
```

2. Restore NuGet packages:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

3. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

### Running the API

```bash
cd InterviewTracking.Api
dotnet run
```

The API will start on `https://localhost:7000` (or the port specified in launchSettings.json)

### Running the MAUI App

For Android:
```bash
cd InterviewTracking.Maui
dotnet build -t:Run -f net10.0-android
```

For iOS (Mac only):
```bash
cd InterviewTracking.Maui
dotnet build -t:Run -f net10.0-ios
```

For Windows:
```bash
cd InterviewTracking.Maui
dotnet build -t:Run -f net10.0-windows
```

## Configuration

### App Settings

The app can be configured through the Settings page:

1. **API Configuration**
   - Enable/Disable API: Toggle to use the app in offline-only or online mode
   - API URL: Configure the base URL for your API server (default: `https://localhost:7000/api/`)
   
2. **Notifications**
   - Enable push notifications for upcoming interviews
   - Email reminders: Configure email address to receive reminders
   
3. **Synchronization**
   - Enable/Disable sync with API
   - Auto-sync: Automatically sync data when changes are made
   - Manual sync: Trigger sync on demand
   
4. **Data Management**
   - Export Data: Export all interviews to JSON file
   - Import Data: Import interviews from JSON file
   - Reset to Sample Data: Restore 13 sample interviews with diverse positions
   - Clear All Data: Remove all interviews from database
   
5. **Appearance**
   - Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes

### Sample Data

The app includes 13 pre-loaded sample interviews for testing:

| Position | Company | Platform | Status |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Senior Software Engineer | Acme Corporation | Zoom | Scheduled |
| Product Manager | Beta Technologies | Google Meet | Stage1 |
| DevOps Engineer | Cloud Innovations Inc | Microsoft Teams | Stage2 |
| Data Scientist | DataViz Analytics | Zoom | FinalRound |
| UX Designer | Design Studios Ltd | Google Meet | Scheduled |
| Frontend Developer - React | TechStartup Inc | Zoom | Scheduled |
| Backend Engineer - .NET | Enterprise Solutions Corp | Microsoft Teams | Stage1 |
| Full Stack Developer | FinTech Innovations | Google Meet | Stage2 |
| Mobile Developer - iOS | Mobile Apps Studio | Zoom | Scheduled |
| QA Engineer - Automation | Quality Systems Inc | Microsoft Teams | Stage1 |
| Technical Lead - Java | Global Tech Solutions | Google Meet | FinalRound |
| Database Administrator | Data Systems Corp | Zoom | Scheduled |
| Security Engineer | CyberSec Solutions | Microsoft Teams | Stage2 |

**Sample Interviewers**: The app also includes 8 sample interviewer contacts (e.g., John Smith - Engineering Manager, Sarah Johnson - Senior Software Engineer) linked to specific interviews for testing collaboration features.

**Managing Test Data**:
- Use "Reset to Sample Data" in Settings to restore these samples
- Use "Clear All Data" to start with a clean database
- Both operations require confirmation to prevent accidental data loss

### Database Storage

- **Windows**: SQLite database stored in `C:\ProgramData\InterviewTracking\interviews.db`
- **iOS/Android**: SQLite database stored in app's data directory

### API Configuration

Update `appsettings.json` in the API project:

```json
{
  "JwtSettings": {
    "SecretKey": "YourVerySecretKeyThatIsAtLeast32CharactersLong!",
    "Issuer": "InterviewTrackingApi",
    "Audience": "InterviewTrackingApp"
  }
}
```

### MAUI App Configuration

The API URL can be configured directly in the app's Settings page. No code changes required!
